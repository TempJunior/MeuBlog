        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
        <p><strong>SchoolBoy Q - Crash</strong></p>
        <p>Uh, go<br>
            Uh, go<br>
            
            Too many M's to make (to make)<br>
            Too many rules to break (to break)<br>
            Too many fightin' that case (that case)<br>
            I gotta find my way (my way)<br>
            Daughter need new shoes (shoes)<br>
            If I lose, she lose (lose)<br>
            And I ain't gettin' used to losses<br>
            <br>
            Days like this, I wish all my locs was unchained (chained)<br>
            I mastered the rap game (game), I mastered the dope game (game)<br>
            Still I feel like that I'm God like on these long flights<br>
            I'm left behind, it don't feel right<br>
            Can't write the script when this real life<br>
            Rich, still dodgin' that bus ride<br>
            From the west side where don't shit slide, we on trip time<br>
            Seen the field in their lies (their lies)<br>
            Can't be serious with no rappers (no rappers)<br>
            Stayed down and what happened? (what happened?)<br>
            Got my daughter that mansion (that mansion)<br>
            Gave my mother that million (million)<br>
            Sold my soul to my feelings (my feelings)<br>
            Can't go blind 'bout these women (no)<br>
            <br>
            Too many M's to make (to make)<br>
            Too many rules to break (to break)<br>
            Too many fightin' that case (that case)<br>
            I gotta find my way (my way)<br>
            Daughter need new shoes (shoes)<br>
            If I lose, she lose (lose)<br>
            And I ain't gettin' used to losses<br>
            <br>
            I'm goin' off 'til I crash<br>
            Fuck all the opps, I kid you not, see we gon' crash<br>
            My thoughts is sick, I don't have no sense, sometimes I crash<br>
            Pour up this 1942, it knock me on my<br>
            It knock me on my<br>
            <br>
            Nigga gotta hit the golf course to get a peace of mind<br>
            Family friends want a piece of mine<br>
            I can tell they all piecin' up<br>
            And I can show 'em where peace resides<br>
            Since eight years old, I knew I'd be rich<br>
            'Cause the college route, it wasn't 'bout shit<br>
            Tried the honest route, but chose house licks<br>
            Tried to lock me up, but can't catch this<br>
            Now where we touch down is on my X list, I'm on a fresh tip<br>
            Too much time of livin' reckless<br>
            Now add that time up on my left wrist<br>
            Lil' rappers ain't impressive (ain't impressive)<br>
            Your tax bracket ain't impressive (ain't impressive)<br>
            You buy a chain, but won't buy no land<br>
            That hashtag should say: Desperate (desperate)<br>
            I'm kickin' game for these young niggas<br>
            'Cause one day they'll meet my daughter, uh<br>
            All that bullshit I taught her, huh<br>
            Way too blessed to be normal, uh<br>
            Upper echelon, but we stand that<br>
            So, girl, be proud that your skin black<br>
            And be happy, girl, that your hair napped<br>
            'Cause the school system won't teach that<br>
            Where your father been, you gon' reach that<br>
            <br>
            Too many M's to make (to make)<br>
            Too many rules to break (to break)<br>
            Too many fightin' that case (that case)<br>
            I gotta find my way (my way)<br>
            Daughter need new shoes (shoes)<br>
            If I lose, she lose (lose)<br>
            And I ain't gettin' used to losses<br>
            <br>
            I'm goin' off 'til I crash<br>
            Fuck all the opps, I kid you not, see we gon' crash<br>
            My thoughts is sick, I don't have no sense, sometimes I crash<br>
